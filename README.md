BoydBytes V 1.1
-Basic working register code using firebase auth
-Current problems, when the application has no activty(afk) a message will pop up saying the U.I stop working, selecting either wate or close the app will just return the app to the page like nothing happened. this might be an emulator problem as even with the application is closed it still persist, need more testing on othe P.C.
